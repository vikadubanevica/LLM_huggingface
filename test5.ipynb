Xamoterol did not induce beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation after short-term (72-hour) or long-term (6-day) infusions. When coadministered with isoprenaline xamoterol did not affect the rate or extent of down-regulation induced by isoprenaline alone. In addition, recovery of beta adrenoceptors down-regulated by isoprenaline treatment was not influenced by xamoterol treatment. In all studies, doses of xamoterol were equivalent to those producing full functional responses to the drug in vivo.'}"

Rats were implanted subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps and exposed to the following treatment regimens: (1) subcutaneous infusion of saline (control), isoprenaline or xamoterol for 6 days, (2) subcutaneous infusion of isoprenaline with co-administration of xamoterol for various periods up to 96 hours, and (3) subcutaneous infusion of xamoterol for up to 96 hours after previous treatment with isoprenaline for 72 hours. Xamoterol did not induce beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation after short-term (72-hour) or long-term (6-day) infusions. When coadministered with isoprenaline xamoterol did not affect the rate or extent of down-regulation induced by isoprenaline alone. In addition, recovery of beta adrenoceptors down-regulated by isoprenaline treatment was not influenced by xamoterol treatment.

The effectiveness, specificity and rapidity of action, the few side effects and the virtual absence of toxicity, have contributed to the widespread use of these compounds. In the last decade, however, the attitude towards BDZ has greatly changed, due to growing awareness and concern about dependence liability, withdrawal phenomena, and long-term side effects. Withdrawal symptoms have been singled out and specified in the contest of a well-defined syndrome with foreseeable onset, duration and remission. Psychic and physical symptoms and disorders of sensory perception can be observed. These manifestations can be suppressed by resuming treatment. The symptomatic and developmental aspects of BDZ withdrawal syndrome are discussed, according to the available literature, with particular reference to clinical features of patients suffering from anxiety and mood disorders.'}"

Xamoterol did not induce beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation after short-term (72-hour) or long-term (6-day) infusions. When coadministered with isoprenaline xamoterol did not affect the rate or extent of down-regulation induced by isoprenaline alone. In addition, recovery of beta adrenoceptors down-regulated by isoprenaline treatment was not influenced by xamoterol treatment. In all studies, doses of xamoterol were equivalent to those producing full functional responses to the drug in vivo.'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Interrupting the adaptive changes in congestive heart failure.\\nCirculating plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin and vasopressin are increased in congestive heart failure. By increasing ventricular afterload, heart failure is further worsened, which in turn--in a vicious cycle--stimulates neurohumoral vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Furthermore, because of the compensatory but excessive stimulation of the sympathomimetic system, a down-regulation and desensitization particularly of the myocardial beta 1 receptors and depletion of myocardial catecholamine occurs in chronic heart failure. These defects may be restored toward normal by interventions that attenuate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. A direct approach to modify the excessive vasoconstriction is to administer systemic vasodilator drugs, but despite favorable short-term effects, tolerance developed to most of these drugs during long-term treatment. One reason for the loss of effectiveness is the reflex activation of the sympathetic system, which increases vasoconstrictor hormone concentrations. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system can be modified effectively by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that have shown favorable responses in patients with chronic heart failure. Beta-blocking agents interfere with endogenous sympathetic activation and have produced beneficial effects in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Long-term treatment is associated with up-regulation of the number of beta receptors and an improved responsiveness to catecholamines. Owing to the negative inotropic effects of beta-blocking agents, some of the patients with severe heart failure deteriorated hemodynamically and clinically. Theoretically, it should be advantageous to have a substance that combines protection against excessive beta stimulation with a mild inotropic support to prevent cardiac decompensation. This may be achieved by a selective beta 1-partial agonist like xamoterol.'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of xamoterol in mild to moderate congestive heart failure.\\nXamoterol, a new beta 1 partial agonist, has the potential to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone in patients with heart failure. Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Local cardiac responses--alternative methods of control.\\nMuch attention has been paid to the influence of the beta-adrenoceptor system on cardiac function in heart failure. Full agonists and partial agonists acting on cardiac beta 1 receptors have been widely investigated, as has the density of these receptors in the failing heart. However, other cardiac control mechanisms may play important roles in the normal heart as well as in heart failure. The Frank-Starling mechanism of enhanced cardiac contraction produced by mechanical stretching of the ventricular myofibrils is well known. When treating patients with heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators and other drugs that influence preload, it is important to consider their overall effects in relation to the Starling curves. Atrial stretching also produces compensatory responses which are currently being intensively studied. Reflex release of atrial natriuretic factor after stimulation of atrial receptors has important physiologic effects in heart failure. The atria, but not the ventricles, are innervated by the vagus; the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart and circulation is often overlooked. The initial increase in heart rate during exercise is primarily due to withdrawal of vagal influence. Besides acetylcholine, the parasympathetic transmitter, many other local hormones may affect cardiac function; these include prostaglandins, 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine. Although the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is mediated primarily through beta 1 adrenoceptors, both beta 2 and alpha receptors are also found in the heart. Myocardial alpha 1 receptors, which mediate a positive inotropic effect, have been identified, and prejunctional alpha 2 receptors may mediate inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Dietary alpha-linolenic acid is as effective as oleic acid and linoleic acid in lowering blood cholesterol in normolipidemic men.\\nThe effect of dietary oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and linolenic acid (LNA) on plasma lipid metabolism was studied in eight normolipidemic men. A mixed-fat diet composed of conventional foods was fed during 6-d pre- and post-experimental periods. The same basic diet but with 75% of the fat (26% of total energy) provided by sunflower and olive; canola; soybean; and sunflower, olive, and flax oils was fed during four 18-d experimental periods. Mean plasma total cholesterol (-18%), low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol, (-22%) and very-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (-41%) concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.004) lower after the experimental diets than after the mixed-fat diet. Mean serum apolipoprotein B (-19%) and apolipoprotein A-I (-9%) concentrations were also significantly (P less than 0.0007) lower after the experimental diets. The experimental diets were equally effective in lowering total and lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein concentrations in plasma, indicating that dietary OA, LA, and LNA were equally hypocholesterolemic.'}]"

Foley, of Yandell, Page & Archer, Burlington, for plaintiff.\\nWilson, Curtis, Bryan, Quinn & Jenkins, Burlington, for defendants.\\nBefore SHANGRAW, C. J., and BARNEY, SMITH, KEYSER and DALEY, JJ.\\nSHANGRAW, Chief Justice.\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment entered in a civil action tried by the Chittenden County Court on December 6, 1972. Jury trial was waived and following a hearing by the court plaintiff was awarded damages in the amount of $14,839.05 and its costs. A judgment for this amount followed, and the defendants have appealed therefrom.\\nPlaintiff, a Vermont corporation, owns and operates the Seaway Shopping Center in South Burlington, Vermont. Its principal stockholder and officer is Thomas Farrell, who developed the shopping center.\\nThe Grand Union Stores, Inc., of Vermont, is also a Vermont corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of The Grand Union Company. The Grand Union company is a Delaware corporation with its principal office in East Paterson, New Jersey. The Grand Union Company is a guarantor of the performance of its subsidiary company under the lease here in question.\\nFor the purposes of this opinion, Seaway Shopping Center is hereinafter referred to as \"Seaway\", The Grand Union Stores, Inc., of Vermont, as \"Tenant\", and The Grand Union Company as \"Parent Company.\"\\nThe original lease, here in question, was between Thomas Farrell and the above Tenant. The Parent Company was guarantor of the Tenant. The lease was subsequently assigned by Farrell to Seaway. Its terms are not in dispute.\\nWithout reciting verbatim all of the pertinent provisions of the lease, the court determined under finding No. 5 that it provided, in substance, as follows:\\n(a) That the Landlord would maintain the surface of the parking area, rights of way, curb-cuts, approaches and sidewalks in good condition.\\n(b) That if the Landlord failed to carry out any of its obligations, the Tenant might, after reasonable notice or without notice if in the Tenant\\'s judgment an emergency should exist, perform the obligation at the expense of the Landlord.\\n(c) That if Tenant did so, it would be entitled to reimbursement from the Landlord, and could apply the claim against subsequent rent installments.\\n(d) That the Landlord should also mark and reline the parking areas as often as necessary.\\n(e) That notices or demands under the lease should be given by each party to the other by mail, to the addresses therein set forth.\\nThe trial court continued with the following findings.\\n6. It is undisputed, and we find, that the Tenant in July 1971, caused a substantial part of the parking area adjacent to its store premises to be repaired and repaved, and subsequently remarked. The cost of the paving was $14,050.00, and of the remarking $903.15, both costs being reasonable.\\n\\n*485 7. It is also conceded, and found, that Tenant made withholdings from its rent as follows:\\n\\n\\nJanuary 1, 1972       $2,500.00\\nFebruary 1, 1972       2,500.00\\nMarch 1, 1972          2,500.00\\nApril 1, 1972          2,500.00\\nMay 1, 1972            2,500.00\\nJune 1, 1972           2,453.15\\n\\n8. It is virtually, if not actually, conceded, and we find, that the remarking in question was required and necessary, whether or not the repaving was, and we find that the deduction of $903.15 by Tenant was justified and is an allowable reduction of plaintiff\\'s claim.\\n9. Since the rental obligation itself is not in question, the central issue here involved is the condition of the parking lot before the repaving was done, i. e. whether it was in \"good condition\" as required by the lease. We find that it was, and that the repaving by the Tenant was not justified. Additionally, no notice of the repaving was given to the Landlord, the notice which was given referring only to \"repair.\" (Def.Ex. T)\\n10. Over the course of six years prior to the repaving, Tenant had from time to time notified Seaway of the recurrent need for repairs to the lot, and Seaway had made them, presumably to the satisfaction of Tenant, since the non-performance clause had not previously been invoked.\\n11. When repairs were needed, Seaway had an arrangement with one Armand Pare and one Rene Barsalou to make them, using their equipment and hot mix (or cold patch in winter) purchased from local suppliers.\\n12. The cost of these repairs to Seaway were as follows: 1966, $760.65; 1967, $20.15; 1968, $670.09; 1969, $232.01; 1970, $469.91; and 1971, $1,835.91. The total is $3,968.72, almost half of which was just before the repaving in question.\\n13. Mr. Farrell testified that the repaving was done by Tenant, not because of necessity, but because it desired to give the premises a \"new look\" and to upgrade the store to meet growing competition. We so find, for the following reasons:\\n(a) By letter of May 5, 1970, the parent company advised Seaway (Def.Ex.L) that the parking area was badly in need of repair, \"creating a very shabby appearance in comparison to the other Shopping Centers in the area.\"\\n(b) It then, in August, 1970, proceeded to get an estimate of the cost of repaving from L. M. Pike & Son, Inc., (Pl.Ex. 2, p. 4) even though it did not proceed with the work.\\n(c) On June 25, 1971, in a telephone conversation with Farrell, Mr. Hayes, Vice-president for the real estate of the parent company (which handled all these matters completely without reference to its subsidiary), asked Seaway to pay half of the cost of repaving, to upgrade the store to meet competition. Mr. Farrell refused, advising Hayes that substantial repairs had already been made and more were in process.\\n(d) At that time, a second quotation for repaving had already been obtained by defendants, and another was in the process.\\n(e) We are unable to find, and defendants\\' evidence could not make clear, who made the decision to repave. Notice was mailed July 1, 1971, although it did not specify that repaving was to be done, referring only to repairs. This notice came from Mr. Charles Bailey, assistant maintenance supervisor for the parent company. The following day he accepted the low quote for the work, and it proceeded.\\n(f) When Mr. Bailey gave this notice and accepted the quote, he did *486 not know repairs had been made, was unaware of the then condition of the lot and had had no communication from local officials of the Tenant about the repairs.\\n(g) Mr. Bailey testified he did not know who in the chain of command made the decision to repave. He thought it might have been the \"legal department.\" A representative of the legal department was present through the trial, but did not testify. The vagueness of this whole line of testimony as to individual decisionmaking within the corporate structure tends to reinforce the conclusion that the reasons for repaving were other than as stated in the formal notice.\\n14. The defendants, although entitled to deduct the sum of $903.15 from the rent, were not entitled to deduct the further sum of $14,050.00. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from defendants that sum, with interest to date in the amount of $789.05, for a total of $14,839.05, plus its taxable costs.\\nIn its conclusions the court, in part, stated:\\nNo substantial legal questions are here presented. As agreed, by the parties, the main issue involved is one of fact, whether the parking lot in question was in good condition under the terms of the lease when the repaving was done, or in such bad condition, unremedied by the landlord after tenant\\'s request, that repaving was necessary. Strengthened by the information that tenant\\'s responsible officials did not know of, or take into consideration, the substantial repairs which landlord had made, we have concluded that the repaving was not necessary, but was done for purposes of \"upgrading\" to meet competition, a worthy motive but not the landlord\\'s responsibility under the lease.\\nThe issues raised by the defendants on appeal are primarily challenges to the findings of fact made by the trial court which they claim are clearly erroneous. The standard by which such a challenge is tested is stated in V.R.C.P. 52(a) thus:\\nFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.\\nThe above Vermont rule is similar to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants argue that this Court should not follow the long history of Vermont case law, but should adopt a new standard now used by the Federal Courts. It is claimed that under the Federal test, this Court should consider all of the evidence when reviewing findings of fact and not only that evidence which would be most favorable to the prevailing party in order to determine whether or not the findings are \"clearly erroneous\". The defendants contend that the crucial findings are clearly erroneous.\\nThis Court has interpreted the clearly erroneous test to require it to \"take the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, . . . excluding the effect of modifying evidence.\" Green Mountain Marble Co. v. Highway Board, 130 Vt. 455, 457, 296 A.2d 198, 200 (1972). Our test, as stated in Armstrong v. Hanover Ins. Co., 130 Vt. 182, 185, 289 A.2d 669, 671 (1972), appears as follows:\\nThe prescribed law of this state is that findings must stand if there is any credible evidence which fairly and reasonably supports them, and this Court must construe them so as to support the judgment, if possible, and further, that the weight of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the persuasive effect of the testimony is for the sole determination of the trier of fact.\\nThis Court thus uses the same interpretation of V.R.C.P. 52(a) as it did *487 under the previous statutory requirement found in 12 V.S.A. § 2385.\\nIn essense, the defendants urge that this Court should reconsider the case of Green Mountain Marble Co. v. Highway Board, supra, and follow the Federal practice of looking to the evidence in its entirety on appeal. They cite United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), as a definitive Federal case on the \"clearly erroneous\" test. That opinion, in part, states:\\n[F]indings of fact in actions tried without a jury \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\". . . A finding is \"clearly erroneous\" when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\\nWhen findings are challenged on appeal, it is the recognized duty of this Court to search such portions of the record as are called to our attention, in order to determine whether or not there is substantial evidence to support them. We must read the evidence in support of the findings if reasonably possible, \"when considered as a whole.\" Little v. Little, 124 Vt. 178, 182, 200 A.2d 276 (1964).\\nIn construing Federal Rule 52(a), the Gypsum case, supra, in effect held that a reviewing court should consider the \"entire evidence\". Under our Vermont Rule 52(a), it was held in the Little case, supra, that the evidence should be \"considered as a whole.\" This leaves very little difference in result between the Federal rule and our case law as applied to our Vermont rule, which we now reaffirm. We are not inclined to give a different meaning to V.R.C.P. 52(a) than has been previously enunciated by this Court in our case law.\\nThe central issue is whether the parking lot in question was in \"good condition\" after it had been repaired by Seaway in June, 1971. It is the contention of the Tenant that the court\\'s finding that the lot was in \"good condition\" prior to repaving is clearly erroneous and that Seaway\\'s evidence as to the good condition of the parking lot after repairs had been made by Seaway was inclusive and equivocal.\\nA number of witnesses were called by the Tenant who testified that prior to the repairs there were depressions, ruts, cracks, holes and soft spots in the parking lot and that the repairs made by Seaway in 1971 at a cost of $1,835.51 were faulty. Also, notwithstanding the repairs, there were six or seven clay spots which, at time of repaving, had to be dug out at a maximum cost of $700. The tenant introduced other evidence that following the repairs made by Seaway the general condition of the lot was poor and needed resurfacing.\\nTo the contrary, Seaway\\'s evidence in the transcript reveals that the repairs made in June, 1971, were done in a good and workmanlike manner, that resurfacing was not necessary, and that following such repairs the parking lot was in good condition.\\nThus, the controversial issue relating to the condition of the parking lot at the time of repaving was left to the court for resolution. Finding No. 9 that the parking lot was in good condition prior to repaving and that the repaving by the Tenant was not justified is amply supported by the evidence.\\nThe Tenant next claims that the trial court\\'s findings of fact that the repaving was done by tenant, not because of necessity, but because it desired to give the premises a \"new look\" and to upgrade the store to meet growing competition is clearly erroneous. On the contrary, Seaway urges that the trial court\\'s finding of fact, No. 13, determining that the repaving was done *488 by the Tenant in its desire to give the premises a \"new look\" is substantially supported by the record.\\nThe question as to whether or not the Tenant was interested in obtaining a \"new look\" is not pertinent to the issue as to whether or not the parking lot was in \"good condition\" at the time of the repaving job done by the Tenant.\\nBy finding No. 13 the court determined that \". . . the repaving was done by Tenant, not because of necessity, but because it desired to give the premises a `new look\\' and to upgrade the store to meet growing competition. . . .\" This finding is reinforced by subparagraphs thereof. In addition to the foregoing finding, and in support thereof, we note the following testimony of the witness, Charles J. Bailey, an employee of the Tenant.\\nQ. It\\'s not necessary to have an even blacktop surface, is it?\\nA. It would be nicer than holes, sir. Having a good parking lot is good advertising.\\nWe find no basis in the record for disturbing finding No. 13. We are bound to confirm this result unless, as a matter of law, it is unsupportable. Villeneuve v. Commissioner of Taxes, 128 Vt. 356, 357, 264 A.2d 774 (1970) citing Forslund v. Cookman, 125 Vt. 112, 114, 211 A.2d 190 (1965). The prescribed law of this jurisdiction is that findings must stand if there is any credible evidence which fairly and reasonably supports them. Largess v. Tatem, 130 Vt. 271, 280, 291 A.2d 398 (1972).\\nThe issue was raised below as to whether, under the terms of the lease, the Tenant gave \"reasonable notice\" in writing to Seaway that the parking lot needed repaving before the Tenant proceeded to do so. This became a controverted issue. The trial court found that the notice given referred only to \"repair.\"\\nAs stated in the findings and conclusions, the court below determined that the parking lot was in good condition by reason of the repairs made by Seaway and that the repaving done shortly thereafter by the Tenant was not necessary. This is the critical and controlling issue upon which the judgment is predicated. Therefor, the above referred to notice, or lack thereof, becomes immaterial in disposing of this appeal, and requires no consideration by this Court.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\n', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'FreeLaw'}}\n"

We so find, for the following reasons:\\n(a) By letter of May 5, 1970, the parent company advised Seaway (Def.Ex.L) that the parking area was badly in need of repair, \"creating a very shabby appearance in comparison to the other Shopping Centers in the area.\"\\n(b) It then, in August, 1970, proceeded to get an estimate of the cost of repaving from L. M. Pike & Son, Inc., (Pl.Ex. 2, p. 4) even though it did not proceed with the work.\\n(c) On June 25, 1971, in a telephone conversation with Farrell, Mr. Hayes, Vice-president for the real estate of the parent company (which handled all these matters completely without reference to its subsidiary), asked Seaway to pay half of the cost of repaving, to upgrade the store to meet competition. Mr. Farrell refused, advising Hayes that substantial repairs had already been made and more were in process.\\n(d) At that time, a second quotation for repaving had already been obtained by defendants, and another was in the process.\\n(e) We are unable to find, and defendants\\' evidence could not make clear, who made the decision to repave. Notice was mailed July 1, 1971, although it did not specify that repaving was to be done, referring only to repairs. This notice came from Mr. Charles Bailey, assistant maintenance supervisor for the parent company. The following day he accepted the low quote for the work, and it proceeded.\\n(f) When Mr. Bailey gave this notice and accepted the quote, he did *486 not know repairs had been made, was unaware of the then condition of the lot and had had no communication from local officials of the Tenant about the repairs.\\n(g) Mr. Bailey testified he did not know who in the chain of command made the decision to repave. He thought it might have been the \"legal department.\" A representative of the legal department was present through the trial, but did not testify. The vagueness of this whole line of testimony as to individual decisionmaking within the corporate structure tends to reinforce the conclusion that the reasons for repaving were other than as stated in the formal notice.\\n14. The defendants, although entitled to deduct the sum of $903.15 from the rent, were not entitled to deduct the further sum of $14,050.00. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from defendants that sum, with interest to date in the amount of $789.05, for a total of $14,839.05, plus its taxable costs.\\nIn its conclusions the court, in part, stated:\\nNo substantial legal questions are here presented. As agreed, by the parties, the main issue involved is one of fact, whether the parking lot in question was in good condition under the terms of the lease when the repaving was done, or in such bad condition, unremedied by the landlord after tenant\\'s request, that repaving was necessary. Strengthened by the information that tenant\\'s responsible officials did not know of, or take into consideration, the substantial repairs which landlord had made, we have concluded that the repaving was not necessary, but was done for purposes of \"upgrading\" to meet competition, a worthy motive but not the landlord\\'s responsibility under the lease.\\nThe issues raised by the defendants on appeal are primarily challenges to the findings of fact made by the trial court which they claim are clearly erroneous. The standard by which such a challenge is tested is stated in V.R.C.P. 52(a) thus:\\nFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.\\nThe above Vermont rule is similar to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants argue that this Court should not follow the long history of Vermont case law, but should adopt a new standard now used by the Federal Courts. It is claimed that under the Federal test, this Court should consider all of the evidence when reviewing findings of fact and not only that evidence which would be most favorable to the prevailing party in order to determine whether or not the findings are \"clearly erroneous\". The defendants contend that the crucial findings are clearly erroneous.\\nThis Court has interpreted the clearly erroneous test to require it to \"take the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, . . . excluding the effect of modifying evidence.\" Green Mountain Marble Co. v. Highway Board, 130 Vt. 455, 457, 296 A.2d 198, 200 (1972). Our test, as stated in Armstrong v. Hanover Ins. Co., 130 Vt. 182, 185, 289 A.2d 669, 671 (1972), appears as follows:\\nThe prescribed law of this state is that findings must stand if there is any credible evidence which fairly and reasonably supports them, and this Court must construe them so as to support the judgment, if possible, and further, that the weight of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the persuasive effect of the testimony is for the sole determination of the trier of fact.\\nThis Court thus uses the same interpretation of V.R.C.P. 52(a) as it did *487 under the previous statutory requirement found in 12 V.S.A. § 2385.\\nIn essense, the defendants urge that this Court should reconsider the case of Green Mountain Marble Co. v. Highway Board, supra, and follow the Federal practice of looking to the evidence in its entirety on appeal. They cite United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), as a definitive Federal case on the \"clearly erroneous\" test. That opinion, in part, states:\\n[F]indings of fact in actions tried without a jury \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\". . . A finding is \"clearly erroneous\" when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\\nWhen findings are challenged on appeal, it is the recognized duty of this Court to search such portions of the record as are called to our attention, in order to determine whether or not there is substantial evidence to support them. We must read the evidence in support of the findings if reasonably possible, \"when considered as a whole.\" Little v. Little, 124 Vt. 178, 182, 200 A.2d 276 (1964).\\nIn construing Federal Rule 52(a), the Gypsum case, supra, in effect held that a reviewing court should consider the \"entire evidence\". Under our Vermont Rule 52(a), it was held in the Little case, supra, that the evidence should be \"considered as a whole.\" This leaves very little difference in result between the Federal rule and our case law as applied to our Vermont rule, which we now reaffirm. We are not inclined to give a different meaning to V.R.C.P. 52(a) than has been previously enunciated by this Court in our case law.\\nThe central issue is whether the parking lot in question was in \"good condition\" after it had been repaired by Seaway in June, 1971. It is the contention of the Tenant that the court\\'s finding that the lot was in \"good condition\" prior to repaving is clearly erroneous and that Seaway\\'s evidence as to the good condition of the parking lot after repairs had been made by Seaway was inclusive and equivocal.\\nA number of witnesses were called by the Tenant who testified that prior to the repairs there were depressions, ruts, cracks, holes and soft spots in the parking lot and that the repairs made by Seaway in 1971 at a cost of $1,835.51 were faulty. Also, notwithstanding the repairs, there were six or seven clay spots which, at time of repaving, had to be dug out at a maximum cost of $700. The tenant introduced other evidence that following the repairs made by Seaway the general condition of the lot was poor and needed resurfacing.\\nTo the contrary, Seaway\\'s evidence in the transcript reveals that the repairs made in June, 1971, were done in a good and workmanlike manner, that resurfacing was not necessary, and that following such repairs the parking lot was in good condition.\\nThus, the controversial issue relating to the condition of the parking lot at the time of repaving was left to the court for resolution. Finding No. 9 that the parking lot was in good condition prior to repaving and that the repaving by the Tenant was not justified is amply supported by the evidence.\\nThe Tenant next claims that the trial court\\'s findings of fact that the repaving was done by tenant, not because of necessity, but because it desired to give the premises a \"new look\" and to upgrade the store to meet growing competition is clearly erroneous. On the contrary, Seaway urges that the trial court\\'s finding of fact, No. 13, determining that the repaving was done *488 by the Tenant in its desire to give the premises a \"new look\" is substantially supported by the record.\\nThe question as to whether or not the Tenant was interested in obtaining a \"new look\" is not pertinent to the issue as to whether or not the parking lot was in \"good condition\" at the time of the repaving job done by the Tenant.\\nBy finding No. 13 the court determined that \". . . the repaving was done by Tenant, not because of necessity, but because it desired to give the premises a `new look\\' and to upgrade the store to meet growing competition. . . .\" This finding is reinforced by subparagraphs thereof. In addition to the foregoing finding, and in support thereof, we note the following testimony of the witness, Charles J. Bailey, an employee of the Tenant.\\nQ. It\\'s not necessary to have an even blacktop surface, is it?\\nA. It would be nicer than holes, sir. Having a good parking lot is good advertising.\\nWe find no basis in the record for disturbing finding No. 13. We are bound to confirm this result unless, as a matter of law, it is unsupportable. Villeneuve v. Commissioner of Taxes, 128 Vt. 356, 357, 264 A.2d 774 (1970) citing Forslund v. Cookman, 125 Vt. 112, 114, 211 A.2d 190 (1965). The prescribed law of this jurisdiction is that findings must stand if there is any credible evidence which fairly and reasonably supports them. Largess v. Tatem, 130 Vt. 271, 280, 291 A.2d 398 (1972).\\nThe issue was raised below as to whether, under the terms of the lease, the Tenant gave \"reasonable notice\" in writing to Seaway that the parking lot needed repaving before the Tenant proceeded to do so. This became a controverted issue. The trial court found that the notice given referred only to \"repair.\"\\nAs stated in the findings and conclusions, the court below determined that the parking lot was in good condition by reason of the repairs made by Seaway and that the repaving done shortly thereafter by the Tenant was not necessary. This is the critical and controlling issue upon which the judgment is predicated. Therefor, the above referred to notice, or lack thereof, becomes immaterial in disposing of this appeal, and requires no consideration by this Court.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\n',\n",

Foley, of Yandell, Page & Archer, Burlington, for plaintiff.\\nWilson, Curtis, Bryan, Quinn & Jenkins, Burlington, for defendants.\\nBefore SHANGRAW, C. J., and BARNEY, SMITH, KEYSER and DALEY, JJ.\\nSHANGRAW, Chief Justice.\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment entered in a civil action tried by the Chittenden County Court on December 6, 1972. Jury trial was waived and following a hearing by the court plaintiff was awarded damages in the amount of $14,839.05 and its costs. A judgment for this amount followed, and the defendants have appealed therefrom.\\nPlaintiff, a Vermont corporation, owns and operates the Seaway Shopping Center in South Burlington, Vermont. Its principal stockholder and officer is Thomas Farrell, who developed the shopping center.\\nThe Grand Union Stores, Inc., of Vermont, is also a Vermont corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of The Grand Union Company. The Grand Union company is a Delaware corporation with its principal office in East Paterson, New Jersey. The Grand Union Company is a guarantor of the performance of its subsidiary company under the lease here in question.\\nFor the purposes of this opinion, Seaway Shopping Center is hereinafter referred to as \"Seaway\", The Grand Union Stores, Inc., of Vermont, as \"Tenant\", and The Grand Union Company as \"Parent Company.\"\\nThe original lease, here in question, was between Thomas Farrell and the above Tenant. The Parent Company was guarantor of the Tenant. The lease was subsequently assigned by Farrell to Seaway. Its terms are not in dispute.\\nWithout reciting verbatim all of the pertinent provisions of the lease, the court determined under finding No. 5 that it provided, in substance, as follows:\\n(a) That the Landlord would maintain the surface of the parking area, rights of way, curb-cuts, approaches and sidewalks in good condition.\\n(b) That if the Landlord failed to carry out any of its obligations, the Tenant might, after reasonable notice or without notice if in the Tenant\\'s judgment an emergency should exist, perform the obligation at the expense of the Landlord.\\n(c) That if Tenant did so, it would be entitled to reimbursement from the Landlord, and could apply the claim against subsequent rent installments.\\n(d) That the Landlord should also mark and reline the parking areas as often as necessary.\\n(e) That notices or demands under the lease should be given by each party to the other by mail, to the addresses therein set forth.\\nThe trial court continued with the following findings.\\n6. It is undisputed, and we find, that the Tenant in July 1971, caused a substantial part of the parking area adjacent to its store premises to be repaired and repaved, and subsequently remarked. The cost of the paving was $14,050.00, and of the remarking $903.15, both costs being reasonable.\\n\\n*485 7. It is also conceded, and found, that Tenant made withholdings from its rent as follows:\\n\\n\\nJanuary 1, 1972       $2,500.00\\nFebruary 1, 1972       2,500.00\\nMarch 1, 1972          2,500.00\\nApril 1, 1972          2,500.00\\nMay 1, 1972            2,500.00\\nJune 1, 1972           2,453.15\\n\\n8. It is virtually, if not actually, conceded, and we find, that the remarking in question was required and necessary, whether or not the repaving was, and we find that the deduction of $903.15 by Tenant was justified and is an allowable reduction of plaintiff\\'s claim.\\n9. Since the rental obligation itself is not in question, the central issue here involved is the condition of the parking lot before the repaving was done, i. e. whether it was in \"good condition\" as required by the lease. We find that it was, and that the repaving by the Tenant was not justified. Additionally, no notice of the repaving was given to the Landlord, the notice which was given referring only to \"repair.\" (Def.Ex. T)\\n10. Over the course of six years prior to the repaving, Tenant had from time to time notified Seaway of the recurrent need for repairs to the lot, and Seaway had made them, presumably to the satisfaction of Tenant, since the non-performance clause had not previously been invoked.\\n11. When repairs were needed, Seaway had an arrangement with one Armand Pare and one Rene Barsalou to make them, using their equipment and hot mix (or cold patch in winter) purchased from local suppliers.\\n12. The cost of these repairs to Seaway were as follows: 1966, $760.65; 1967, $20.15; 1968, $670.09; 1969, $232.01; 1970, $469.91; and 1971, $1,835.91. The total is $3,968.72, almost half of which was just before the repaving in question.\\n13. Mr. Farrell testified that the repaving was done by Tenant, not because of necessity, but because it desired to give the premises a \"new look\" and to upgrade the store to meet growing competition. We so find, for the following reasons:\\n(a) By letter of May 5, 1970, the parent company advised Seaway (Def.Ex.L) that the parking area was badly in need of repair, \"creating a very shabby appearance in comparison to the other Shopping Centers in the area.\"\\n(b) It then, in August, 1970, proceeded to get an estimate of the cost of repaving from L. M. Pike & Son, Inc., (Pl.Ex. 2, p. 4) even though it did not proceed with the work.\\n(c) On June 25, 1971, in a telephone conversation with Farrell, Mr. Hayes, Vice-president for the real estate of the parent company (which handled all these matters completely without reference to its subsidiary), asked Seaway to pay half of the cost of repaving, to upgrade the store to meet competition. Mr. Farrell refused, advising Hayes that substantial repairs had already been made and more were in process.\\n(d) At that time, a second quotation for repaving had already been obtained by defendants, and another was in the process.\\n(e) We are unable to find, and defendants\\' evidence could not make clear, who made the decision to repave. Notice was mailed July 1, 1971, although it did not specify that repaving was to be done, referring only to repairs. This notice came from Mr. Charles Bailey, assistant maintenance supervisor for the parent company. The following day he accepted the low quote for the work, and it proceeded.\\n(f) When Mr. Bailey gave this notice and accepted the quote, he did *486 not know repairs had been made, was unaware of the then condition of the lot and had had no communication from local officials of the Tenant about the repairs.\\n(g) Mr. Bailey testified he did not know who in the chain of command made the decision to repave. He thought it might have been the \"legal department.\" A representative of the legal department was present through the trial, but did not testify. The vagueness of this whole line of testimony as to individual decisionmaking within the corporate structure tends to reinforce the conclusion that the reasons for repaving were other than as stated in the formal notice.\\n14. The defendants, although entitled to deduct the sum of $903.15 from the rent, were not entitled to deduct the further sum of $14,050.00. Plaintiff is entitled to recover from defendants that sum, with interest to date in the amount of $789.05, for a total of $14,839.05, plus its taxable costs.\\nIn its conclusions the court, in part, stated:\\nNo substantial legal questions are here presented. As agreed, by the parties, the main issue involved is one of fact, whether the parking lot in question was in good condition under the terms of the lease when the repaving was done, or in such bad condition, unremedied by the landlord after tenant\\'s request, that repaving was necessary.

The standard by which such a challenge is tested is stated in V.R.C.P. 52(a) thus:\\nFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.\\nThe above Vermont rule is similar to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Highway Board, 130 Vt. 455, 457, 296 A.2d 198, 200 (1972). Our test, as stated in Armstrong v. Hanover Ins. Co., 130 Vt. 182, 185, 289 A.2d 669, 671 (1972), appears as follows:\\nThe prescribed law of this state is that findings must stand if there is any credible evidence which fairly and reasonably supports them, and this Court must construe them so as to support the judgment, if possible, and further, that the weight of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the persuasive effect of the testimony is for the sole determination of the trier of fact.\\nThis Court thus uses the same interpretation of V.R.C.P. 52(a) as it did *487 under the previous statutory requirement found in 12 V.S.A. § 2385.\\nIn essense, the defendants urge that this Court should reconsider the case of Green Mountain Marble Co. v.

That opinion, in part, states:\\n[F]indings of fact in actions tried without a jury \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\". . .

We must read the evidence in support of the findings if reasonably possible, \"when considered as a whole.\" Little v. Little, 124 Vt. 178, 182, 200 A.2d 276 (1964).\\nIn construing Federal Rule 52(a), the Gypsum case, supra, in effect held that a reviewing court should consider the \"entire evidence\". Under our Vermont Rule 52(a), it was held in the Little case, supra, that the evidence should be \"considered as a whole.\" This leaves very little difference in result between the Federal rule and our case law as applied to our Vermont rule, which we now reaffirm. We are not inclined to give a different meaning to V.R.C.P. 52(a) than has been previously enunciated by this Court in our case law.\\nThe central issue is whether the parking lot in question was in \"good condition\" after it had been repaired by Seaway in June, 1971.

            "Example 4: {'text': 'Enceinte de son deuxième bébé, Marion Maréchal a choisi un prénom étranger avec son mari, mais Zemmour fait rage !\\nLors de la présidentielle de 2022, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen et Eric Zemmour ont porté ensemble le drapeau du nouveau parti Reconquête! Lorsqu’ils ont échoué, les deux représentants du parti d’extrême droite ont intégré les législatives. En parallèle, la nièce de Marine Le Pen a d’autres préoccupations, dont l’arrivée de son deuxième enfant.\\nSeul bémol est que le prénom non français du bébé de Marion Maréchal susciterait la rage à Eric Zemmour.\\nC’est en 27 avril dernier que Marion Maréchal a annoncé en public la date prévue de son accouchement. La famille accueillera le nouveau-né le 18 juin 2022. Le second tour se déroule à cette même date. Cette date est tout de même le jour de l’appel du Général de Gaulle en 1940, lors de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, selon l’animatrice de l’émission Restons Zen. Lorsque la présentatrice a demandé à la maman si le prénom de son bébé serait « Charles alors ? », elle a répondu qu’elle a choisit un prénom étranger.\\nComme le répond Marion Maréchal, « Oui, vous direz ça à mon mari italien, il veut un prénom italien lui ». « Prénom italien pour Zemmour, comment vous allez justifier ? », martèle France Anaïs Bourbon. « Je ne me laisse pas faire », déclare la future maman à vive voix. Ce prénom non français risque pour autant de créer un vacarme dans le parti d’Eric Zemmour, lui-même prêt à avoir un enfant avec son partenaire Sarah Knafo.\\nMarion Maréchal serait sur le point d’abandonner les législatives\\nAu vu de la situation, Marion Maréchal annonce : « Je ne suis pas sûre de pouvoir mener cette bataille à 100% en tout cas sur le terrain ». D’ailleurs, elle est tenue de formuler sa position très prochainement. C’est d’autant plus le cas des alliances entre son ancien parti et le parti de Zemmour.
